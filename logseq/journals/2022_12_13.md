	- so for a none ob expression
	- it is like contract -> contract -> kv
	- ?
	- because I only see one [[mapping]] in [[Rainterpreter]]
	- [[msg.sender]] -> [[namespace]] -> [[kv]]
	- always
	- yes so for none ob contracts, those that can do [[k/v storage]], [[namespace]] is the same as [[msg.sender]]?
	- say [[FLOW]] contract
	- [[msg.sender]] is [[FLOW]] contract, [[namespace]] is also [[FLOW]] contract
	- [[namespace]] is 0 in that case
	- can a contract set the 2 types of [[namespaces]] at the same time?
	- like be public one and private one?
	- like have some storages like contract -> 0 -> k/v
	- and some other like contract -> owner -> k/v
	- the answer is that the contract sets the [[namespace]] when it calls IInterpreterV2.[[evalWithNamespace]] instead of IInterpreterV2.[[eval]]
	- let’s add a place for [[interpreter-ts]] and [[forecast]]/simulation too
	- each onchain entity of the [[interpreter]], calling contract and [[expression]] sets its own [[namespace]] and they all combine into an overall sandbox
	- I’ll write the dev doc for it, and we can add it to it
	- actually i'm hoping if it's really easy to just spin up and link pages, that everyone can get more involved in writing things up
	- we already have docs for [[rainlang]] and [[expression]] writing
	- a few paragraphs of dot points goes a long way
	- but needing to write a 10 page doc is pretty overwhelming
	- i think most of them are just generated from incoming references
	- if you click on one in [[logseq]] you'll see it just puts the incoming info there
	- which is actually pretty cool you can meta-document something just by [[tagging]] it
	- which is way better than a normal [[wiki]]
	- there's also a [[GPT]] plugin on the marketplace that i saw @highonhopium_josh
	- literally if ppl just copy and paste in bits of conversations in the journal and tag stuff, that will auto generate a ton of docs
	- there's a [[TG bot]] in the marketplace too
	- and i saw a [[merge plugin]] that can combine pages if there's a typo etc.
	- @rouzwelt https://docs.logseq.com/#/page/publishing%20(desktop%20app%20only)
	- looks like native support for turning it into a [[static site]]
	- could even make a [[rainlang]] plugin 😉
	- what would it do?
	- some [[syntax highlighting]] would be nice
	- @rouzwelt dunno if you saw the convo i was having with @highonhopium_josh around whether [[literate style]] might work for rainlang
	- that would really make [[studio]] truly like python/r stuff
	- yeah just do some [[tagging]]
	- does it put literally everything in there?
	- is the idea that someone goes through and links everything up?
	- if we can harness our raw TG stream of consciousness somehow that would be amazing
